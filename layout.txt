Layout
------

I'm having issues trying to come up with a more controlled layout generation
system that doesn't need either a graph drawing algorithm (slow and imperfect).

Maybe looking at some simpler systems in more detail would help:

- Automatic GUI style layout system based on tree-of-boxes and tree-grammars.

A box grammar needs horizontal and vertical boxes.
