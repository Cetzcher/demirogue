monsters
========

Ideas of monsters.

* Leave a trail of stuff.
* Have a cloud or bad stuff surround the monster, e.g. Brogue's Zombies.
* Attack all surrounding verts.
* Knight's move. Not sure how that would work in a graph based map though...
* Only able to move to vertices with a distance of 2 from the current vertex.
* Move two verts every other turn.
* Move very quickly when not in LoS.
* Obscure LoS.
* Reset 'known' vertices to 'unknown'.
* Summon and run away.
* Summon and consume summons for some kind of bonus.
* Explode on death.
* Sap the player at a distance and run in for the kill.
* Become insubstantial and walk through the player.
* 'Haunt' the player and control movement.
* Impregnate the player with a parasite that will burst out later.
* Rotating laser beam, i.e. attack each surrounding vertex in an order.
* Throw nearby enemies at the player.
* Kill other monsters to 'level up'.
* Multiply on hit, e.g. jellies or rats in MicRogue.
* Telegraph attack by bouncing then leap where player was next turn.
* Telegraph attack with crosshairs on the floor and attack next turn.
* Mimic player movement directly or oppositely.
* Buff nearby monsters, e.g. Brogue totems.
* 'Turtle' and become invulnerable to some or all attacks.
* 'Ignite' or otherwise transform the terrain the player is on.
* Steal items from the floor or the player.
* Reanimate after death, maybe a few turns lag.
* After an attack become a fast moving but non-attacking form, e.g. Shiren's Master Hen.
* Teleport or blink the player.
* Pull the player closer to the monster.
* Push the player away from the monster.
* Swap positions with the player, e.g. Eyes in MicRogue.
* Try and surround the player with invulnerable monsters that only attack once fully surrounded.
* Mimics and shapeshifters.
* Combine like Power Rangers...
* Disperse 'seeds' like those mushroom things in Crawl.
* Be invisible unless very close.
* Temporarily reduce players view distance.
* Restrict player movement, e.g. can't move away from monster like DCSS's Sirens.
