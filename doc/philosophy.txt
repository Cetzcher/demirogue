MUST

- Short play time: full play time shouldn't be more than roughly an hour.
- No grind.
- Simple inventory: managing a large inventory isn't really fun for me.
- Simple, clean and consistent UI.
- No no-brainers.
- No insta-death.
- Optimal play is not drudgery: so traditional roguelike traps are out.
- Classless but still have build agency: Shiren and Brogue are classless but builds can be too random.
- Replayable:
  - Fixed branch structure (a la crawl) is boring.
  - Fixed level themes (Shiren, Binding of Isaac) is also boring.
