Constraint Propagation Solver (CPS)
-----------------------------------

- Domains
- Variables
- Constraints
- Solver

The high-level solver loop needs the following from variables:
- Size or some other value to prioritise variable sort order.
- Ordered or random iteration of the variables domain.
- Narrow with whatever the iteration returns.
- Needs to know if the variable is singular/unique.
