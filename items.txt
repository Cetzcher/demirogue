Ideas for items.

* Bow. Although a single hit point game must control it somehow:
  * Takes a turn to ready the bow. Then a turn to fire.
  * A hit causes a status effect rather than death.
* Damage each surrounding vertex.
* Damage in an arc, e.g. 90 degress, focussed on attack direction.
* Push monsters away from the player.
* Create a LoS obscuring cloud.
* Boomerang that attacks in a loop.
* Holographic shadow that attracts enemies.
* Lay a trap for enemies to walk into.
* Become invisible if you stay still.
* Boots that let you walk over certain terrain.
* Leave a trail of slime that slows walking enemies.
* Time limited levitation.
* Summon a minion to attack monsters.
* Wellies that protect you from lightning.
* Box to hide in.
* Time manipulation a la ToME 4, e.g. save state, kill enemy within time limit, revert to state without enemy.
